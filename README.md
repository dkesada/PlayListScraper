# PlayListScraper
Web scraper for youtube playlists.

I have many playlists in YouTube of 300+ videos, and keeping record of the videos inside them is a mess. Whenever a video gets deleted by the uploader or by YouTube, it simply says "Deleted video" (same for when it goes private). So, if I wanted to replace that video, I had to remember wich one was it. Needless to say, it's not possible with lengthy playlists.

In order to avoid this, I used to make screenshots of the playlist and I would keep them in a file for future reference in case a video got deleted.

I grew tired of this after a while and decided to make this process automatic.
